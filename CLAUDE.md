This project is a Jetbrains extension using intelliJPlatform, written i Kotlin. Write code accordingly.

Don't add comments to any code you add, however keep any existing comments you find.

All commands for building, testing, linting etc are maintained at the Makefile. They're configured to not emit much output unless they fail; that's normal. Use a 10 minute timeout.

When you deem it necessary, run `make iter` which runs tests and linters related to the current set of Git changes.
