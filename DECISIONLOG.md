# CodeScene JetBrains Plugin Decision Log

The purpose of this Decision Log is to document important decisions made during the development of the CodeScene
JetBrains plugin. It helps provide clarity and rationale for each decision, making it easier to understand why certain
choices were made and to review them later if needed. This log serves as a reference for current and future team
members, ensuring transparency and consistency throughout the project lifecycle.

## DEC-2024-09-12-001: Choose Kotlin for Plugin Development

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

**Date**: 2024-09-12

**Decision Maker(s)**: Dzenan Granulo, Selma Copra

**Status**: Accepted

**Decision**:
The project will use Kotlin for developing the JetBrains plugin.

**Context**:
We needed a language that is fully supported by JetBrains IDEs and provides modern features for plugin development.
Kotlin is known for its concise syntax and compatibility with existing Java code.

**Rationale**:
Kotlin was chosen because it is officially supported by JetBrains and provides better type safety and null-safety
features compared to Java. Although the Platform API was written in Java, Kotlin is fully interoperable with the API and
is preferred for its modern features. Many Platform features require Kotlin to function effectively, and understanding
Java is only necessary when reviewing the documentation or the API code.

**Consequences**:
This decision means the team will need to be proficient in Kotlin. It also aligns the project with modern practices and
JetBrainsâ€™ recommended approach.

**Alternatives Considered**:

- **Java**: While Java is a well-known option, it lacks some of the modern features that Kotlin provides, like
  coroutines.

**Related Decisions**:
None

## DEC-2024-09-12-002: Determine Supported Product Versions for the Plugin

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

**Date**: 2024-09-12

**Decision Maker(s)**: Dzenan Granulo, Selma Copra

**Status**: Accepted

**Decision**:
The plugin will support IntelliJ IDEA versions from the last four major releases: 2024.X, 2023.X, 2022.X, 2021.3 and 2021.2.

**Context**:
To provide a balanced support coverage while avoiding the need to release updates for every version of the JetBrains IDE, it is essential to focus on the versions that are most widely used by the user base. Supporting a broader range of versions can increase the plugin's accessibility but also requires more maintenance.

**Rationale**:
Statistics from August 2023 show that the majority of users are on the latest major release and the two previous major releases. Supporting these versions will cover approximately 80% of the user base, addressing the needs of the vast majority of users while maintaining a manageable maintenance workload. The statistics indicate:
- The latest version is used by roughly 50% of users.
- Supporting the latest major release and the two preceding releases will ensure broad compatibility without excessive support burden.

**Consequences**:
The plugin needs to be tested and maintained for compatibility with IntelliJ IDEA 2021.3, 2021.2, 2022.X, 2023.X, and 2024.X.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Supporting All Versions**: This approach would be more comprehensive but would increase maintenance efforts significantly.
- **Supporting Only the Latest Version**: This would reduce maintenance but might exclude a significant portion of users.

**Related Decisions**:
None

## DEC-2024-09-12-003: Choose JDK 17 for Plugin Development

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

**Date**: 2024-09-12

**Decision Maker(s)**: Dzenan Granulo, Selma Copra

**Status**: Accepted

**Decision**:
The project will use JDK 17 for developing the JetBrains plugin. The plugin will support IntelliJ IDEA versions from 2021.X to 2024.X.

**Context**:
We needed to select a JDK version that aligns with the JetBrains IDE versions that the plugin will support, ensuring compatibility and future-proofing.

**Rationale**:
JDK 17 was chosen because it supports the range of JetBrains IDE versions from IntelliJ IDEA 2021.X to 2024.X. This covers all the major releases we plan to support:

- **IntelliJ IDEA 2024.X**: Up to Java 22
- **IntelliJ IDEA 2023.X**: Up to Java 20
- **IntelliJ IDEA 2022.X**: Up to Java 18
- **IntelliJ IDEA 2021.X**: Up to Java 17 (excluding *IntelliJ IDEA 2021.1*)

JDK 17 is the lowest supported version among all these IDE versions and ensures compatibility with key features like sealed types and always-strict floating-point semantics.

**Consequences**:
This decision means the project will use JDK 17 for development, which aligns with the needs of a wide user base and
future-proofs the plugin against upcoming IDE versions.

**Alternatives Considered**:
None
